What is Machine learning?
-Machine learning provides an ablity to machine to learn automatically through experience without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine learning?
 - Supervised Learning[Labelled data->Known Output]
    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machine
    - K Nearest Neighbour
    - Random Forest
 - UnSupervised Learning[Unlabelled data->Output]
    - K-Means
    - Apriori
    - C-Means
 - Reinforcement Learning[Self Learn and Build data-> Make Ouput][Rewards or Punishment]
    - Q-Learning
    - SARSA

> Supervised Learning: In Supervised machine learning ,machine learn through labelled data and build an algorithm to make prediction.
    - Regression->Linear,Multiple and Logistic Regression
    - Classification
> UnSupervied Learning: In UnSupervised machine learning ,machine learn through Unlabelled data and bulid an algorithm to make prediction.
    - Association->Apriori
    - Clustering->K,C-Means
> Reinforcement Learning: In Reinforcement learning ,machine is left at specific place in which machine explore the environment and based on data received it build an algorithm to make prediction.
